Project Schedule Summary

Based on the information currently on hand, Integrated Solutions believes that the proposed project will require six months of dedicated work to complete. This includes each of the steps mentioned in the methodology section of the document with the exception of maintenance which will be the responsibility of Northwest Labs. The bulk of the time will be the building and testing phases. Due to the high availability and integrity needs of the application, these phases will include constant colaboration with Northwest Labs to assert that each subsystem developed meets the user and cultural expectation as they are completed. Time has been allocated for adjustment to original design and implementation and the final product will be familiar to Northwest Labs due to continued involvement
